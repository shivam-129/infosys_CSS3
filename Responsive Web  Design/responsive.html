<!-- We can make a web page's layout change according to the screen size using the below techniques

Fluid Layouts

Flexible Images

Media Queries 

Flexible Images 

The image grows or shrinks according to the container dimensions. We need to specify the width of the image using the percentage of its container width.

Setting the width of foreground images

We will apply relative dimensions to the <img> element

Problem: Consider we have an image that needs to be displayed at 150X150 size inside a 720 px wide element and we want it to scale it as the parent element scales.

Solution: For the above problem, we can have a container exclusively for the image, set its relative size on the container, and let the image fill container width.

i.e., 150/720 = 20.8333%

and to scale the image when the parent scales but limit the extent to which it scales up/down we can set max-width/min-width on the parent. 

Setting the width of the background images

Problem: Consider we want the background image to scale when the element for which background is set to scales.

Solution: For the above problem, we can set background-size: 100%

Fluid Layouts

Layout grows and shrinks according to the viewport dimensions. We need to use relative units such as % instead of absolute units (px).

In order to fit the layout to viewport width, we will replace absolute units for dimensions of elements(px) with relative units (%)

The width of the topmost element (<html>) is browser width (due to viewport tag)

Thus specifying the width of all elements using % will scale the layout to the viewport width. Such a layout is called fluid layout 

We need to represent all px widths as % of the corresponding parent width.

Media queries

Media queries apply CSS styling based on the device form factors. Hence the layout can differ on a desktop, tablet, and mobile

@media screen and (max-width: 520px) {
  .body {
    background: none;
  }
}

Line 1: This media query hides a background image for the element with the class body when the page is viewed on a screen and browser viewport width is lesser than 520px, 

@media starts a media query 

screen: CSS to be applied only to screen media type

max-width: Apply CSS if the screen size is 520px wide, or less

Media Types

The important media types are 

Media Type

Description

all

Applies to all devices (default value)

handheld

Applies to handheld devices

print

Applies to printer 

screen

Applies to any type of screen

tv

Applies to TV screens

 

Media Features

The important media types are 

Feature

Values

min/max

Description

device-height, device-width

number 

Yes

Height/Width of the output device (specified in px, em,  etc.)

height, width

number

Yes

Height/Width of the viewport

orientation

landscape | portrait

No

The orientation of the device 

resolution

number

Yes

Resolution(pixel density) of the device (in dpi, dpcm, etc.)

device 

number

Yes

The number of device pixels per CSS pixel. Used to detect high-resolution screens like iPad retina

 -----------------


 It is observed that sometimes mobile devices display a full desktop site. In such cases, the computed page width is much higher than the expected and hence the appropriate media queries will not be applied. It also results in pages being zoomed out on mobile devices.

To overcome the above problem we can use the viewport meta tag

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scale=0">
When we set width=device-width the page will be as wide as the device which prevents default zooming out actions on some mobiles

When we set initial-scale=1.0 the page is unscaled initially and cannot be further scaled by the user

The viewport is the area on a browser where the page is rendered.

Viewport width > Browser width > page is wider than browser
