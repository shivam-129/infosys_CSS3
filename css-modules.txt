CSS3 is the latest version of CSS. CSS3 provides new styling elements using which we can style webpages without any additional tools.

Unlike the previous versions, CSS3 is divided into Modules. It contains the "old CSS specification" which has been split into smaller pieces. In addition, new modules like border, shadow, color, transition, animation, and many more have been added.
