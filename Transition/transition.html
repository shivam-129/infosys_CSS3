<!-- Transitions are gradual changes in the properties of an element when it changes from one style to another.

Using CSS3 transition effects can be added to elements without the need for any scripting or additional software like Flash.

To add a transition, two things must be specified:

The CSS property to which the effect should be added.

The duration of the effect.

transition: height 3s;
Here in the above syntax,

height is the CSS property to be transited

3s is the duration for the animation 



ransition        Description

transition-property

Includes CSS3 properties that need to be transited over a period of time
For example height, width, background, color, etc
It accepts a comma-separated list of properties to be transited.
It accepts the “all” keyword as a value that specifies that all the properties need to be transited.

transition-duration

Sets the duration (sec/msec) of transition. If this duration is not mentioned then the transition will not have any effect.

transition-timing-function
Controls the pace/speed of the transition. The key terms used are linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, steps.

transition-delay

Specifies the delay before starting the transition.

-------------


The transition timing function is used to specify the pace/speed of transition.

This can be done in 2 ways.

Specifying the pre-defined functions.

transition-timing-function

Description

ease

Transition speed will be slow at the start and end and fast pace in between.

linear

Transition speed will be the same throughout.

ease-in

Transition speed will be slow at the start.

ease-out

Transition speed will be slow at the end.

ease-in-out

Transition with slow speed at the start and end and linear speed in between

steps

Allows specifying intervals for the timing function.

Defining a custom function by specifying four co-ordinates to define a cubic bezier curve.

The Cubic Bezier curve is defined by 4 points P0, P1, P2, and P3.

P0 and P3 are the start and end of the curve hence they have values 0 and 1 by default. We specify the x and y coordinate values for P1 and P2 to the cubic bezier curve function.

cubic-bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)
In the above syntax,
x1,y1,x2, and y2 are the x and y-coordinates of points P1 and P2.
transition-timing-function: ease, linear;
cubic-bezier(0,1.1,0.8,4)
 
In the above example,

Multiple transition functions can be specified for multiple properties by separating them with a comma.

-------------------

steps() timing function enables us to break the transition into steps.

For example: If I want to transit a square that moves 400px to right on hover in 4 seconds then the square would move 100 pixels to right for every second.

This function accepts 2 arguments.

steps(int, start|end)

The first parameter specifies the number of intervals to which the transition should be broken. This should be a positive number greater than 0.

If the second parameter value is 'start' then the transition will happen at the beginning of each step.

If the second parameter value is 'end' then the transition will happen at the end of each step.

There are 2 pre-defined variants of the steps function

step-start which is equivalent to steps(1, start)

step-end which is equivalent to steps(1, end)

div
{
    transition: 4s steps(4);
}
div:hover
{
    left: 400px;
}
Here in the above code snippet,

Line 3: The transition will be broken into 4 intervals.
